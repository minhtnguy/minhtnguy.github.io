# Droneforce

A new autonomous drone service (powered by Agentforce) for inspections, monitoring, and various field service use cases.

## Overview

At Salesforce, I worked on the Emerging Tech team, where I designed and built the company's first agentic drone workflow prototype in four weeks.

This POC was showcased to executive leadership at Salesforce and Slack, featured across **four** keynotes and activations at Dreamforce 2025, and lanched as a product in just 3 months.

<Callout
	subtitle="Problem"
	description="Field inspections are time-intensive and fragmented: technicians climb assets, gather evidence, and upload documentation long after the work is done."
	title="What if we could automate field service work with drones to improve efficiency and safety?"
/>

## Solution

Droneforce introduces a new agentic workflow using Skydio X10 drones and Slack as the main orchestration layer for autonomous drone missions, handling mission setup, flight execution, data retrieval, inspection review, and triggering next actions, all in one conversation thread.

## Implementation

As the design engineer, I shaped the end-to-end UX across scenarios from emergency response to routine inspections.

We demoed this prototype with a real Skydio X10 drone where I connected Skydio Cloud, Salesforce Agentforce, and Slack so a drone can be planned, launched, monitored, and reviewed directly in Slack, with mission data automatically routed into Slack for follow-up actions.

Core components:

- **Skydio Cloud:** for drone flight planning and execution
- **Salesforce Agentforce:** for mission planning and analysis
- **Slack:** for communication and mission updates
- **Salesforce Field Service:** for work order management and tracking

We were able to showcase this prototype at Dreamforce 2025 in person and it was awesome to see all the drone activations in action and my work showcased across the conference!
