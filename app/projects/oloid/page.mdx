# Oloid

<Divider />

## Overview

[Oloid](https://oloid.ai/) is a company working on reimagining physical security and access in
the workplace by retrofitting existing badge readers with their M-Tag device. During my time there,
I worked on redesigning the admin management portal for web and mobile interfaces.

## Role

Product Design Intern - UI/UX Design, Prototyping, Brand Identity, Graphic Design

June 2022 - September 2022

## Key Users

The primary product journey of M-Tag, from installment to everyday use, consists of 3 different users.
Since I working on designing the admin management portal I focused on the needs of tenant admins.

## Problem

The current Oloid admin management portal was unintuitive and visually outdated with old brand
guidelines. Additionally, there is a lot of hand holding during the transition between the Oloid
admin and tenant admin.

## Solution

Redesign the admin management portal with Oloid's new brand guidelines and improve the overall
navigation experience for tenant admins so that they can install the M-Tag devices on their own.

## Design System

One of my first tasks was to consolidate Oloid's new brand guidelines into a design system to allow
for consistency and reusability of components.

This was my first time working with such an intricate design system so I learned a lot about working
with components, Figma auto layout, and documentation on when to use certain components, font sizes,
and colors.

## Reflection

This was my first professional experience as a designer and I was able to learn so much.
I learned the importance of asking questions to better understand product requirements and user
needs. User insights can come from unlikely places, such as conversations with sales and customer
success teams, so it's important to work cross-functionally with everyone on the team!

Additionally, I learned how important the design process is for you as a designer, but it might
not matter to other stakeholders. As the only designer, it was important for me to decide what
tools and methods to inform my designs. I learned how to be self sufficient and make the most of
the resources I had.
