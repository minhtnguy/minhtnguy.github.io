# Feeding Pets of the Homeless

A donation management portal for pet food donation sites across the nation.

<ProjectTags />

## Context

[Feeding Pets of the Homeless](https://petsofthehomeless.org/) (FPH) is a national nonprofit that connects people experiencing homelessness with resources for their pets. Their organization has helped over 30,000 pets nationwide!

As part of [Commit the Change](https://ctc-uci.com/), a student led organization at UC Irvine that creates software for local nonprofits, our team helped create a donation management portal for donation sites across the U.S and Canada, as well as an internal portal for their admins.

## My Role

I had the privilege to lead a team of 4 UX designers, guiding them through the design process for this project, while planning sprint meetings, collaborating with tech leads, and communicating with stakeholders.

## Project Requirements

As design lead, I was one of the main point of contacts between FPH and our team. The tech leads and I held several client meetings to identify their requirements, constraints, and provide project updates. We then summarized our insights into a comprehensive product requirements documents, which served as key reference guides for our team of designers and developers.

## Problem

FPH's current quarterly donation reporting process is inefficient and time-consuming. Donation sites must manually submit their donation totals, while their admins have to repeatedly remind sites and manually input the data, resulting in a tedious and error-prone workflow.

## Solution

Our team focused on creating two central portals:

- **FPH:** Allows admins to automatically send reminders, manage donation sites, and review submitted forms and applications
- **Donation Site:** Allows donation sites submit their donation totals, view past submissions, and view their donation impact

## Design Details

### Donation Site Registration

For the donation site sign-up flow, we highlighted clear statistics and broke down the registration process into multiple pages in order to reduce friction for new donation sites.

### Donation Site Portal

In the Donation Site portal, admins can view their donation statistics and upcoming due dates reminding them to submit their donation totals for the quarter.

### FPH Portal

In the FPH portal, administrators can access real-time notifications about donation site statuses through a side drawer. This design choice maintains unobstructed access to the main page, enhancing navigation and usability.

### Developer Handoff

To streamline developer handoff, we utilized detailed annotations and interactive flow arrows within our Figma designs, clearly illustrating state transitions and hidden functional features.
