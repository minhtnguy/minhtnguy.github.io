# IDM Thesis

## Week 0
**Project Proposal**:
AI Augmented Video Collaboration

My project explores how to combine AI with tone, gesture, and spatial interaction to reimagine virtual brainstorming and make ideas and references into artifacts that participants can see and move.

## WEEK 1

**Hand Gesture Experiments**
Using Media Pipe, I experimented with different hand gestures and movements to control components on the screen, as well as physics and motion of objects.

**Refining the Project**

Thinking of brainstorming, collaboration, and conversation as a story, I want to viualize these conversations as a spatial storyboard.
