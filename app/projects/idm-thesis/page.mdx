# IDM Thesis

## Week 0
**Project Proposal**:
AI Augmented Video Collaboration

My project explores how to combine AI with tone, gesture, and spatial interaction to reimagine virtual brainstorming and make ideas and references into artifacts that participants can see and move.

Using AI to analyze the live voice transcript of the conversation, it would generate references and artifacts that are relevant to the conversation. Participants can then use hand gestures to control the artifacts and move them around the screen.

## WEEK 1

**Hand Gesture Experiments**

Using Media Pipe, I experimented with different hand gestures and movements to control components on the screen, as well as physics and motion of objects.

**Experiment 1**

Pinch to grab objects and resize them.

**Experiment 3**

Fun physics experiment with dots that move around as the hand moves around.
