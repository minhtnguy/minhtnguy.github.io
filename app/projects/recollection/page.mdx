# ReCollection

A reimagined way of engaging with your saved inspiration, not as fixed references, but as material that continues to evolve and reveal new patterns depending on your current context.

## Overview

This project was created in my UX & AI course at NYU, where we explored how to design meaningful, human-centered interactions with AI.

For this project, I focused on a question that felt problem that I personally faced in my own creative workflow.

I collect screenshots, photos, and references for inspiration, but they often disappear into the void of random files and folders on my computer or half-forgotten Pinterest boards.

The act of saving is easy. The act of returning is **hard**.

#### How might we help users revisit and make sense of the images they save over time?
